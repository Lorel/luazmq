LuaZMQ
=====

ZeroMQ binding for Lua

This binding relies on ZeroMQ 4.0.x+ C API!

It's divided into low level C++ part and high level Lua part.
Therefore there are two files luazmq.dll (luazmq.so) and zmq.lua.

Dependencies
============
To build and use LuaZMQ successfully you need:

* ZeroMQ 4.0.x+
* A standards-compliant C++ complier. (Visual Studio 2012 is preferred)
* Lua 5.1.x, LuaJIT 2.0.x
* Lutok - https://github.com/soulik/lutok
* update lua5.1.props so that you've got correct paths for Lua header and library files

Usage
=====

## Req part without polling

```lua
local zmq = require 'zmq'

local context = assert(zmq.context())
local socket = assert(context.socket(zmq.ZMQ_REQ))

socket.options.identity = "A client #1"

assert(socket.connect("tcp://localhost:12345"))

assert(socket.send("Test message"))
local result = assert(socket.recvAll())
print('Returned answer: ', result)

socket.diconnect()

```

## Rep part with polling

```lua
local zmq = require 'zmq'

local context = assert(zmq.context())
local socket = assert(context.socket(zmq.ZMQ_REP))

socket.options.identity = "A client #1"

assert(socket.connect("tcp://localhost:12345"))
assert(socket.bind("tcp://*:12345"))

local poll = zmq.poll()
	
poll.add(socket, zmq.ZMQ_POLLIN, function(socket)
	local result = assert(socket.recvAll())
	local identity = socket.options.identity
	local data = "Hello: "..identity..". This is a reply to: "..result
	socket.send(data)
	print('Received: ', result, 'from: ', identity)
end)

while true do
	poll.start()
end

socket.diconnect()
```
